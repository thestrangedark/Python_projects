def ode_system(X,t,*params):  #???what is the point of * ???
    '''
    The ode system is defined in terms of state variables.
    I have as unknowns:
    x: position of the piston (This is not strictly needed unless I want to know x(t))
    xdot: velocity of the piston
    p1: pressure on right of piston
    p2: pressure on left of the piston
    For initial conditions, we see: x=x0=0, xdot=0, p1=p1_0=p_a, p2=p2_0=p_a
    :param X: The list of state variables.
    :param t: The time for this instance of the function.
    :param params: the list of physical constants for the system.
    :return: The list of derivatives of the state variables.
